In the past I have been using home carpet cleaners for forever, and they don't work very good and I really had lost hope. I was contemplating replacing the carpets!! Anthony did his magic and they have NEVER looked so good! I had a stain on the carpet in my daughter's room that I scrubbed myself. I could never get up. It is gone!! Thank you, Anthony. I appreciate all your hard work and dedication to doing your job to superior status! Well done!! ðŸ¤©",
