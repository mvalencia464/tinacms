He recently cleaned a carpet that I thought would have to be replaced, but after his work was done, I was literally blown away! During my evening talk after work, I bragged about him to my husband. My husband said, he must CARE about what he does and I agreed. He assess the work, he keeps everything in order, he's prompt and efficient, very personable and most important, he's honest.",
